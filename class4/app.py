#  + is an operator 
# 4 are operands
# 4 + 4

# Operator, a symbol that can operate two operands depending on the symbol that we are using, addition, mul, div, sub

# Arithmetic operator:
# print( 4 + 5)
# print( 4 - 5)
# print( 4 * 5)
# print( 4 / 5)


# modulus operator?
# remainder:
# print( 9 % 2)
# print( 91 % 2)


# Exponentiation 
# 2 * 2 * 2 = (2)3 
# 2 ** 3
print( 2 ** 3)

# expression
b=56
a=56
c=a+b
print(c)

# incrementing
print( a + 1)

# decrementing 
print( a - 1)
ab = 45

# in other programming language incrementing
# print(ab++)

# in python 
#  ab = 56
# ab = ab + 1
# ab = 57


# ac = 34
# ac = ac - 1
# ac = 33


# temprature = 4.5
# decimal point
# float


# BODMAS 
# MDAS

# order of operations
print (2 + 2 / 3 * 2 - (3*2))
