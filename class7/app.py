# logical operators are used to perform logical operations
#  if an apple is red, put that in a red basket.
# if your names starts with A, you should pronounce your name a bit different.


# an expression that invludes a logical operator is called a logical expression.
# and, or, not

ab = 45
bc = 56
print(ab + bc / ab * bc)

# Boolean Expression: Expressions that evaluate to either true or false.
# print(45 > 56)

# (==)
# check if 2 is equal to 2 or not.
# print(2 == 2)

# (!=) check if something is not equal to another value.
# print(3 != 4)

# 1
# And operator
# That checks for two different coditions
# In case Alex pass the test, and I fail it, in that case I need to work hard.

# If I get there on time and I present the thesis well, I will be awarded by $100.

#  if 1 is greater than 2 and 4 is greater than 1, print hello there.

# checking two different conditions

print(45 > 34 and 12 > 3)

a = 45

b = 34
# equality operator used with And 
if (a == 45 and b == 304):
    print("Hellloooo there")
# if both values are true it will produce a true value
#  if both are false it will produce false
# if one of them is true it will still produce false

# Or operator
if (a== 56 or b== 34):
    print("printyyy")

# it will produce true only if both are true or a single expression is true.
# if both are false it will produc a false value
